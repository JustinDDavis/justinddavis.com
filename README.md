# Hi there

It looks like you found the code to the webpage I use to host my resume. (justinddavis.com)

I've used this as a way to work on a few technologies that I don't get to use very often: 
  - Gatsby
  - React
  - CircleCi
  - AWS
    - Cloudfront
    - S3

It's not the most beautiful page in the land, but it is mine.
